## COMMENTS:

The file is not compiled to an exe for ease of changing properties of the code. Threading is used to assure that multiple entries can be sent at once, however, because the 7up Website is slow to respond this can sometimes cause crashing. Anyone is welcome to remove the threading and have the program enter the raffle 1 by1 .
